# Graph models

## Description

Graph models are **classes** used to **create objects modelling graphs**. They information about graph **vertices** and **edges** which connect them.

Models also store graph-related **data**. Each graph **vertex** and **edge** can **hold data** which can be then used by the [custom renderer](pages/renderers/index) to **render** graph component with **desired appearance**.

Graph models make it possible to **modify graph** (add/remove vertices/edges) **without** the necessity to **re-render** the whole graph structure.
