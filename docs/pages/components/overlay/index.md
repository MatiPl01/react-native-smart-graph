# Overlay components

## Description

Overlay components are components **rendered over the canvas**. They have **access to canvas-related data** stored in **context** providing particular canvas functionalities.

Currently, there is only **one predefined** overlay component with **simple controls** (more details [below](pages/components/overlay?id=graphviewcontrols)).

You can write your **own overlay components** (explanation in [this](pages/components/overlay?id=custom-components) section). They are just **like plain React Native components** but have **access to canvas data**, thus can offer some **additional functionality**.

## Available overlay components

- [GraphViewControls](pages/components/overlay/controls)
- [Custom components](pages/components/overlay/custom)
