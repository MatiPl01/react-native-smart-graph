# Custom overlay components

<!-- TODO - add this to documentation once the library code is polished and no more major changes to the inner logic will be made -->

> [!NOTE]
> This part of documentation will be **added later**, once the first stable version is released. Custom components touch parts of the **inner logic** which **might change**, so adding documentation for this part makes no sense for now.

> [!TIP]
> If you need to create your **custom component**, please look at the `GraphViewControls` component implementation and **experiment with** it to achieve the desired result.
