# Components

Graph components provide the core functionality of the library. Their main functionalities involve rendering the graph structure representation on the canvas, responding to user gestures and other interactions, as well as dynamically visualizing graph modifications.

## Available components

- [GraphView](pages/components/view) - the main component responsible for rendering the canvas and handling user gestures,
- [Graphs](pages/components/graphs) - components responsible for rendering graphs on the canvas, managing graph placement, transitioning vertices and edges on graph modifications, etc.,
- [Overlay](pages/components/overlay) - components rendered above the canvas, used e.g. to modify canvas settings.
