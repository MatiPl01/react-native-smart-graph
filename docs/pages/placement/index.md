# Placement strategies

<!-- TODO - add link to the graph component section -->

The placement strategy determines the **relative position** of graph vertices. It is used to calculate vertices positions **based on certain conditions**, such as **relative connections** of vertices or some **different criteria**.

Depending on the graph you want to render, some strategies might be more applicable than others. For example, for tree-like graph structures, the best results will be achieved with the `trees` placement strategy.

The placement strategy can be set via the `settings` property of the graph component (more details in [this]() section).
